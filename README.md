===========

We implemented feedback design principle by displaying a visual spinner in every visualization page .This would allow users know the page they requested is loading.As well as messages on  what can its clickable and  by using a consistent color fonts on links/buttons.For interaction styles, we used menu/tab selection to prevent errors when navigation to another page.Both the tab and labels are clickable, this improve users  experience and navigation.And we allow users to navigate from one social media to another with having to log out and log back in.
For the login page, we implemented error prevention design by making social media label and icon clickable allowing user enter account by either medium.
